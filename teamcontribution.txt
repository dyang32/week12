#Team contribution

Our team is doing Web Server using Apache, our team name is called N-Arctica.
We have 5 members, the member names and their responsibilities are:
	Vang - research
	Kao - documentation
	Don - testing
	Rony - Support
	Jorge - Changes roles as needed

We have a Github project located at:
https://github.com/taimaishuze/n-arctica-web-server/projects/1
Here you can find all our resources we've been sharing and using along with steps and tasks that need to be done.
Also, we have a group chat on Signal.

I've manage to make a web server with my Raspberry PI at home, you can visit the link at:

Although we managed to get a web server up we still have alot of testing and documentation to do.
I look forward to getting more involved and learning more.
